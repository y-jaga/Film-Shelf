# Movie-Curator

Here I built a movie curation app where users can search for movies using the TMDB API, add them to a watchlist, wishlist, or curated lists, and provide reviews and ratings. I also implemented features like sorting, searching by genre/actor/director, and displaying top-rated movies. Everything is publicly accessible.
